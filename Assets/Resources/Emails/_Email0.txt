Dear [NAME]

We at the Last Line of Defence Division (L.L.O.D.D) is happy that you take your duty and time to be part of our operation.
Our task and main objective are to save the world from extra-terrestrial threats, any disastrous meteors or asteroids that could smash onto our planet and wipe us all out.
From here on out, you will be far away from [BIRTHPLACE], you are at an isolated classified location to ensure that our particularly important work cannot be tampered with. Which means you need to move and settle at our place of operation.
Now, you would have been given information that is valuable, such as access codes and passwords to gain access to such contractions that you are authorized to use, you will be given a card of such details, after memorizing it, destroy the card so no leaks will come out.
In case you forget the password, our computers will include a way to change the password, though hopefully you don’t need to use the feature, especially at a time of crisis.
If you have any further questions, feel free to send any replies.

Once again, thank you for joining the LLODD.
