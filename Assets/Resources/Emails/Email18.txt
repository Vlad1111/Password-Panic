What's the point of sending my sibling a message will never be seen.
I don't know why I even bother sending these to you.
You ignore me for months, MONTHS! and I don't know what to do.
Maybe that job is getting to you, maybe you don't have internet there and can't reach me.
Whatever the reason I'm done.
Done talk to you, I mean, if you mean your pet [pet type], then don't worry, I am taking good care of [pet name], practically my pet now.
Until you reach me again, I won't send you any more messages, plain and simple.
I hope you have a good time with your job.
