Hey [NAME]

Got a problem with your [Pet type].

Don’t worry, [pet name] is still kicking, just being… unusual.
Like you instructed, I took [pet name] to our favourite park, you know, near the Greenbeard fantastical pirate playground, the one we spend our days playing when we were kids? We went there and what we found were… they fenced off the whole playground, there were a bunch of builders and it look like they were taking down the site.
I was kinda devastated to see our childhood place being torn down. I went up to one of the builders and they told me that kids weren’t playing on the playground anymore, focus more on video games and QikSec.
Really really bad, but that’s not the worst part.
Afterwards, [pet name] looked sad, I tried to feed them but they didn’t eat, it’s been a week and that bowl is still full. I think it has to be something to do with that playground being torn down.
You got to help me [NAME],  what should do?
Please reply back, I miss you.
