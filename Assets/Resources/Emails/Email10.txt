Hey!

It's Fred again, you know, the science guy working on the laser and making calculations and all that. you do remember me right?

Anyway, I just wanted to know where you are from.

Only asking because I want to know more about you.

I think I got at the tip of my tongue, I think it's.... [Birthplace] right?

Please send me a message if I'm right. otherwise I'm going to spend the day being embarrassed.

Your friend.
Fred.
