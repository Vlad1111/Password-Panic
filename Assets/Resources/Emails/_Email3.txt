Hey!
How's my good friend who spends [Pronoun1] days manning a laser that's never going to be used?
Yeah I feel good too.
Say, after work hours, do you want to watch Slasher Fever 14? Yeah, I know you have a bit of sense on the horror genre, and sure, each installation of the series gets goofier at the time, but it's still like… one of the best films out there.
Plus it can be something to do in this dull workspace, food for thought.

It's Fred by the way. You know who I am… right?
Let me know when you are available to hang out.

From your friend
Fred.
