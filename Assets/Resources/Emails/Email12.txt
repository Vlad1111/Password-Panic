Sorry! I am panicking from the END OF THE WORLDO!

YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING, WHAT KIND OF IDIOT FIREAS EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU!?
THOSE LAYOFFS SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!

You know the password, right? because I don't. not entirely, I've been busy doing other stuff that I kinda forgot it.
but if I remember... it's.... maybe it's... [chain1]
maybe that's the first part of it, but I don't know the rest.

You would know, it's the very reason they kept you around.

So don't just sit there, but do the very thing you meant to do!

You are OUR ONLY HOPE!

and if we die, then let me say goodbye my friend, it was nice working with you.

From your friend, in life and death.
fRED!
