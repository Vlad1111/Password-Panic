I cannot believe it

My sibling, out of everyone on the planet, missed my birthday!

No voice chat, no call, not even a post wishing me happy birthday.

You have to remember that my birthday was yesterday.

I know you are at work all the time and I know it is really REALLY Important, but you got to know your family, we were raised together, all I wanted is someone I care for to care for me too.

At this point, I think you are doing this on purpose.
I cannot take this anymore.
