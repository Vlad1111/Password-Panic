Dear workers of the facility

As lead operator of the LLODD laser facility, I am happy to announce that we are holding a birthday celebration of our long lasting employer. Mr. Klien.
The man had been working in the facility since its construction back in the 10s and had been working daily for the past 32 years.
On his Birthday, we will be decorating the relaxation room for the occasion, any volunteers are welcome and will be gratefully rewarded for their effort. 
Feel free to notify me or any of my assistants for volunteering.
If you want to bring gifts for Klien, you are welcome.

Kind regards.
Mr. Buzz Joliman
Lead Operator of main planetary laser defence facility.

P.S
If you are going to bring food or snacks for the party, do not bring [Favourite food] as Mr. Klien despise that kind of food.
