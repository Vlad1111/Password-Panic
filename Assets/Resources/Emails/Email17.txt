I can't believe this!

I CANNOT believe this crap!

I got a PHD in science, dedicated my life to my work and design for the laser, I even calculated what seemed to be an threat to a more ease low percentage to calm everyone down!

And this is how they repay me? to fire me because it's 'not in their budget'?

Even Mechanic Joe got laid off, MECHANIC JOE!!! the best engineer that knows that laser more than I do.

You know what? fine? if they don't want me, that's just fine.

I'll tell you what, I will march up to the boss's office and let everything out!
When you see me with a box full of good memories here, then it shows that the LLODD failed at their job.

Hopefully I can find other work, I'll let you know what I end up doing after doing a little job searching, I know you never reply or talk to me since you got here, but talking to you just feels... refreshing. at least I got your email so we can stay in contact.

Speak to you again.

From your friend.
Fred.
