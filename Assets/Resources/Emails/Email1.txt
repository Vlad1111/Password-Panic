It's me, [Sister Name]

I just want to  check on my best sibling in the world of your brand new job.
Of course you didn't tell me where you are working, or where the workplace is, you should tell me, that way I can visit.

Please send an email back to me, I would like to text to you, but I know you ignore your texts, you prefer the old fashioned emails that are for boring old dudes.

Anyway, I really want to talk more! Please send an email back!
P.S: I am taking good care of [pet name].
