Dear [Name]

You likely would have heard of the latest cut costs of the budget in defence. mainly defence in outside threats. which affects our own facility on how we run the place.

I regret to inform you that there is a total of [d:Staff total - 2] members of our entire staff members, have been laid off for the sake keep within the budget.

Fortunately, you are not one of the laid off staff, as your job as laser operator is important enough.

This will mean that the only people of staff are you and me.

And soon you, because I got long deserved vacation to Japan, meaning you will be running the entire facility by yourself at the end of this year.

I know, a big task, but it wouldn't be an issue, especially when the likelihood of imminent danger is incredibly low.

Just wanted you to know to ease any concerns and worries for the major layoffs of the facility.

Keep up the good work

Kind regards.

Mr. Buzz Joliman
Lead Operator of main planetary laser defence facility.
