Hello rookie.

You won't know me just yet, but the guys around this place call me Mechanic Joe.

If you have already guess, I am a mechanic of this facility, the laser is my baby, I take good care of it, make sure it's operational in case of emergencies. like an asteroid or something like that.

I am writing to you because I notice the kind of person you are.
I don't know how you managed to get this job, maybe you studied hard and got enough qualifications, or maybe the recruiters didn't care who they hire and used a dartboard to find their candidate. it would certainly explain a lot around her.

But I am not complaining, my biggest complaint the idea everyone sharing the same account

I mean, have you seen the password? How it's structured doesn't make sense, I know putting random words in each section of the password would make it unpredictable, but come on, one of the middle sections is [chain2], and all it takes is a spy to figure it out.

But you can't blame it on me, blame the guys who made the computers and code. I just put it all together for them.

Overall, in case you forget the password, you can always come to me and I'll tell you.

Hope to see you more in this place, and hope you are one of the good ones.
