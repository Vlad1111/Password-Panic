Dear workers of the facility
Dear [Name]

It has come to my attention that you have already forgotten your own password and request to a change.

While we do not regularly accept this request for multiple reasons, our guide did include such an exception when the new recruit had only been in the facility for less than a month. In that turn we will accept your request but only a partial part of the password.

As you know, the password is separated into four sequences that includes words and/or numbers that is based on several information collected from either personal data or the data of our operation. mixed by our own artificial intelligence who runs the numbers and make the password hard to crack, especially when we have an occasional scammer managing to go through our email system and make emails that we prefer to ignore. once again our intelligence will notify and remove any threat of these scam emails.

what change will be the last section of the password, and it relates to the subject of [chain4]

Kind regards, from your boss.

Mr. Buzz Joliman
Lead Operator of main planetary laser defence facility.
