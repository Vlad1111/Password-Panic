YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN STOLEN
Your login for the laser controls has been stolen by a hacker and now you need to change it!

Please press onto this link to change your password:

(Link removed, this is another scam, the laser operator should know how to change the password and know that it's not from an email link. This is why we use verifications to prove identity. 
The scammer will be traced, identified and arrested for hacking into an official mainframe.)
