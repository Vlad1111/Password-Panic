Remember me? I have a very hard feeling that you are intentionally ignoring me for the sake of doing your job, maybe you are too busy, I don't see how you need more time working when your job is to maintain a laser that is just lying there collecting dust.
Well not really, our janitors keep our facility clean and tidy.
But I am writing this email to you that we might have some problems.
Here in the science department, we discovered a new asteroid in our solar system, one that is as large as Russia and believed that if it ever hit Earth, then the shockwave and blast fire will instantly kill all and any life on the planet.
Bad right?
Thankfully I did some calculations and found out that there is only a 0.53 chance of that ever happening.
Oh, and in case you didn't know, I am a one of the scientists of the facility, doing the calculations and formulas for our operation, which should be obvious if we hang out more.

Anyway, just letting you know about our discovery, something to think about for a moment and hopefully never think again.

See you at lunchtime! we can have [Favourite food], I know you love that kind of food.

From your friend.
Fred.
